# Rosetta üõ∞Ô∏è


_A container-centric Science Platform_


Rosetta makes it easy to run interactive workloads on batch and remote computing systems using Docker and Singularity containers.

Rosetta licensed under the Apache License 2.0, unless otherwise specificed.


## Quickstart

Requirements:
    
    Bash, Git and Docker. Runs on Linux, Mac or Windows*.

*Windows not fully supported in development mode due to lack of support for symbolic links.

Setup

	$ rosetta/setup

Build

    $ rosetta/build

Run

	$ rosetta/run


Play

    rosetta/populate
    # You can now point your browser to http://localhost:8080.
    # To run Slurm jobs use partition "partition1"

Clean

	# rosetta/clean

### Configuration

Example Webapp configuraion

      - SAFEMODE=False
      - DJANGO_LOG_LEVEL=CRITICAL
      - ROSETTA_LOG_LEVEL=ERROR
      - ROSETTA_TUNNEL_HOST=localhost # Not http or https
      - ROSETTA_WEBAPP_HOST= 
      - ROSETTA_WEBAPP_PORT=8080
      - LOCAL_DOCKER_REGISTRY_HOST=
      - LOCAL_DOCKER_REGISTRY_PORT=5000
      - DJANGO_EMAIL_SERVICE=Sendgrid
      - DJANGO_EMAIL_APIKEY=
      - DJANGO_EMAIL_FROM="Rosetta <notifications@rosetta.local>"
      - DJANGO_PUBLIC_HTTP_HOST=http://localhost # Public facing, with http or https



### Extras

List all running services

    # rosetta/ps

Check status (not yet fully supported)

    # rosetta/status



### Building errors

It is common for the build process to fail with a "404 not found" error on an apt-get instrucions, as apt repositories often change their IP addresses. In such case, try:

    $ rosetta/build nocache


### Development mode

Django development server is running on port 8080 of the "webapp" service.

To enable live code changes, add or comment out the following in docker-compose.yaml under the "volumes" section of the "webapp" service:

    - ./services/webapp/code:/opt/code
    
This will mount the code from services/webapp/code as a volume inside the webapp container itself allowing to make immediately effective codebase edits.

Note that when you edit the Django ORM model, you need to make migrations and apply them to migrate the database:

    $ rosetta/makemigrations
    $ rosetta/migrate


    
### Logs and testing

Run Web App unit tests (with Rosetta running)

    $ rosetta/logs webapp
    
    $ rosetta/logs webapp startup
    
    $ rosetta/logs webapp server
    
    $ rosetta/test

    
## Known issues

    SINGULARITY_TMPDIR=/...
    .singularity in user home with limited space


## Testing

Rosetta test are still in great need of expansion, however basic functionalitis and container builds are already automatically tested on Travis on each codebase push. [Check status on Travis](https://travis-ci.org/sarusso/Rosetta/)
